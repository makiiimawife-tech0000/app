## Demo vs Real Mode

### Demo Mode ‚úÖ (Safe, No Risk)
- Uses fake $1000 balance
- Shows real Polymarket markets and prices
- Simulates trades instantly
- Perfect for learning and testing
- **No login required**
- **No real money**

### Real Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è (Coming in Phase 2)
- Uses your real Polymarket account
- Executes real trades
- Real money, real profit (or loss)
- Requires API credentials
- Start small ($10-50 recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### "No markets loading"
- Check internet connection
- Polymarket API might be temporarily down
- Click "üîÑ Refresh" to try again

### "Can't install dependencies"
```bash
# Try upgrading pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Then install again
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "PyQt6 won't install"
- Make sure you have Python 3.11+
- On Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt6`
- On Windows: Should work with pip

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Demo Mode**
   - Select different markets
   - Watch for arbitrage opportunities
   - Learn how it works

2. **Understand the Strategy**
   - Arbitrage happens when YES + NO < $1.00
   - Buy both sides, merge for $1.00
   - Profit = $1.00 - (YES + NO + fees)

3. **When Ready for Real Mode**
   - Get Polymarket API credentials
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your credentials
   - Switch to Real Mode in app
   - Start with small amounts!

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the main README.md
- Review config.yaml for settings
- Check logs/ folder for detailed logs

## Safety Reminder

- Demo mode is completely safe (fake money)
- Real mode uses real money - be careful!
- Start small when going live
- Understand the risks
- Test thoroughly in demo first

Happy arbitraging! üöÄ
